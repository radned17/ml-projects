## Time Series Modelling 

We propose a hypothesis suggesting a causal relationship between two stochastic processes, each defined in distinct state spaces with differing dimensions. The first process corresponds to a thermocamera video capturing faces, while the second represents a music recording.

The aim is to compare the self-forecasting of the first process with its forecasting that also incorporates insights from the second process. If the latter demonstrates superior performance, it could indicate a causal relationship between the two processes. This conclusion rests also on the assumption that an opera performance is highly unlikely to be influenced by its audience.
